            I’m a qualified educational psychotherapist specialising in helping
            children to overcome emotional barriers to learning.

            I support families and schools to understand a child’s behaviour and
            learning needs through listening to their experiences and working
            directly with the child.

            I’ve worked in schools as a therapist, teacher and senior leader for
            10 years. I understand the demands of the education system and how
            to navigate it to get the best results for my clients.
