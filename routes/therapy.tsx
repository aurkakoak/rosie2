          Each session is tailored to the unique needs of your child; no two
          sessions are the same. Here’s an example of the tools I might use in a
          session.

            <h4>Art</h4>
            Many children find it much easier to express themselves through art
            than in words. We might draw, paint or model according to your
            child’s interests.

            <h4>Reading and writing</h4>
            Exploring fictional characters and places can help your child to
            understand their own world. For reluctant readers or writers, the
            pressure is taken off as I can read to them or scribe their ideas,
            gradually leading them back to finding pleasure in literature.

            <h4>Small world play</h4>
            It can be far easier to show your feelings through those of a
            character. Some children love to use dolls, animals or characters
            from TV to express their experiences and emotions

            <h4>Games</h4>
            I use a huge variety of games in my work, from Connect 4 to chess.
            They all give your child the opportunity to practice taking turns,
            winning, losing and making mistakes in a safe and calm environment.
